1. Modeler: application that records a user's browser session and creates a flow diagram in real time using an LLM (claude sonnet 4.5) for now based on the actions. This flow chart determines the basic order of actions to perform in the browser, identifies behavior by either semantic elements (click the red button) or specific DOM breakpoints. (each node in the flow can be explicit or LLM enabled), such as "when ELEMENT WITH CLASS=<classname> appears, click it", or "TYPE IN <payload> into text entry with classname or id=<id> and press button". It leverages the LLM maximally to gather info on the user's behavior and create a realistic flow diagram. The user can modify this diagram explicity or with a prompt that targets specific nodes and identifies how to change it

THis flow diagram should be a visual that appears over the page (could be a chrome extension drop down, or basically anything that sits nicely over a web browser where the user can see what they are doing on the web browser while they do this action)
2. Take a given flow diagram and run it in the browser. Nodes are either explicit automations with DOM selectors, or AI browser use automations where an LLM (like claude computer/browser use) reads the site and performs an action, or reads in information
3. Add authentication save to the flow (the user opens up a browser and logs in, and the orchestrator tab (a seperate web app) shows the logins and auth it has access to)
4. A system where users control flows via an orchestrator tab, and can run many flow automations in parallel, and set up a given breakpoint on the flow diagram or add a custom one, at which point an alert springs up on the orchestration
