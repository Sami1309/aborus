Below is a complete, engineering‑grade plan to build your own agentic browser automation stack around the open‑source browser‑use agent and Playwright—with:

Parallel deterministic runs,

Breakpoints that halt / gate flow when an element or content is reached,

An AI “selector miner” that learns DOM context and produces robust selectors,

A manual runner that replays those steps without AI,

AI fallback only when things drift, so you stay cheap and fast while learning continuously.

Where I cite specific capabilities or APIs, those come from the official browser‑use docs/README and Playwright docs, linked inline.

Why this split?

Playwright Test gives you stable, parallel execution and rich assertions out of the box. 
playwright.dev
+1

browser‑use gives you an agent that can interact, reason, and log complete step history; you can hook the agent and build custom tools to mine selectors and decide when to hand back to Playwright. 
docs.browser-use.com
+2
docs.browser-use.com
+2

You keep AI costs low by running deterministic flows first and only invoking the agent to heal when selectors drift or pages change. (browser‑use supports pluggable LLMs and cost tracking.)

1) Tech stack & repo layout

Languages

Python 3.11+ for browser-use agent. Quickstart and model wiring are Pythonic. 
GitHub

Node 20+ for Playwright Test runner to maximize parallelism & ecosystem.

Monorepo structure

/agent/                    # Python package (browser-use + custom tools/hooks)
  /tools/                  # selector mining, element introspection tools
  /hooks/                  # lifecycle hooks
  /bridge/                 # minimal RPC to orchestrator (REST/gRPC)
  requirements.txt or uv.lock

/runner/                   # Node playwright-deterministic runner
  playwright.config.ts
  /flows/                  # versioned deterministic flows (YAML/JSON)
  /src/lib/selectors.ts    # selector helpers & candidates-to-locator logic
  /src/lib/breakpoints.ts  # breakpoint DSL (see §5)
  /tests/generated/        # codegen emitted from agent runs

/orchestrator/             # small service (Node or Python FastAPI)
  # queues jobs, shards workloads, triggers agent fallback, updates registry

/shared/selector-registry/ # DB migrations & client
  schema.sql               # tables: pages, steps, selector_candidates, runs

/infra/                    # CI, docker, secrets templates

2) Key capabilities you’ll implement
2.1 Parallel deterministic runs (Playwright)

Playwright Test runs test files in parallel by default; you can enable fully parallel mode project‑wide and control workers; add sharding in CI when needed. 
playwright.dev
+1

Example playwright.config.ts:

import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  fullyParallel: true,                // run all tests across files in parallel
  workers: process.env.CI ? '50%' : undefined,
  retries: 1,
  reporter: [['html'], ['list']],
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry'           // capture traces for debugging
  },
});


(Parallelism options and trace viewer are first‑class in Playwright.) 
playwright.dev
+1

2.2 “Breakpoints” when an element/content appears

Implement as wait gates that pause or emit a callback when a condition is true:

Prefer locator‑based, web‑first assertions (expect(locator).toHaveText/BeVisible) over raw waitForSelector—this is Playwright best practice and reduces flakiness. 
playwright.dev
+1

Provide a typed Breakpoint DSL (see §5) and a breakpoint() helper used inside flows.

2.3 AI selector miner → deterministic playback

browser‑use exposes tools (actions) and lifecycle hooks; you’ll wrap click/input tools so every time the agent acts on an element, your wrapper collects multiple selector candidates (role/label/text/data-testid/CSS) and pushes them to the Selector Registry along with page signature. 
docs.browser-use.com
+1

The agent’s run() returns a history object (actions, outputs, screenshots, etc.) that you can parse to emit deterministic Playwright steps. 
docs.browser-use.com

Keep the deterministic runner as primary. If a step fails (locator missing or assertion fails), invoke the agent with current URL + context to heal and refresh selectors (see §6).

2.4 Continuous learning with AI fallback (cheap-first)

Route all jobs through a policy: deterministic first; on failure → limited agent (cap steps/tokens) to fix just the broken step, produce updated selectors, and re‑emit a patch to the flow file. (browser‑use supports any OpenAI‑compatible or Gemini model, so you can use a small/cheap model by default.) 
docs.browser-use.com

Track token/costs per run using browser‑use Monitoring → Costs. 
docs.browser-use.com

3) Selector Registry design

Tables

pages(id, host, path, signature_hash, created_at)

steps(id, page_id, step_key, purpose, created_at)

selector_candidates(id, step_id, strategy, value, score, last_success_at, last_failure_at, meta_json)

runs(id, started_at, finished_at, type: 'det'|'ai_fallback', outcome, trace_url)

Scoring

Start with heuristic priority:

Role/Label/TestId (Playwright’s generator prioritizes these) 
playwright.dev

Robust CSS w/ attributes (avoid XPath unless truly needed) 
playwright.dev
+1

Update score as an EMA of pass/fail per candidate; prefer the top‑scoring candidate at runtime. Annotate with page URL pattern & a DOM fingerprint (e.g., <h1> text + key aria landmarks).

4) Selector mining (browser‑use)

Hook strategy

Use lifecycle hooks (on_step_start, on_step_end) to read current page and the agent’s chosen action. You can inspect state, DOM via CDP, and history in the hook. 
docs.browser-use.com

For each interactive action (click/input), call a custom tool that runs a DOM probe (via evaluate) to harvest attributes around the target—innerText, role, data-testid, name/label text—and compute candidate selectors. 
docs.browser-use.com

Example (Python, simplified)

# /agent/tools/selector_miner.py
from browser_use import Tools
from typing import Dict, Any

tools = Tools()

@tools.action(name="mine_selectors_for_index",
              description="Given an element index used by click/input, return robust selector candidates")
async def mine_selectors_for_index(index: int, browser_session) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Returns something like:
    {"candidates": [{"type":"role","value":"getByRole('button', {name:'Add to cart'})"},
                    {"type":"testId","value":"[data-testid='add-to-cart']"},
                    {"type":"css","value":"button.btn-primary:has-text('Add to cart')"}]}
    """
    cdp = await browser_session.get_or_create_cdp_session()
    # Use CDP to identify the index-th element from the agent's last query context.
    # Then JS-evaluate to gather attributes (role, name, labels, test ids, classes, text, etc.)
    # Return ranked candidates.
    ...


Wire this tool into a wrapped click:

@tools.action(name="click_wrapped")
async def click_wrapped(index: int, browser_session):
    # 1) mine selectors
    sel = await tools.registry.execute_action('mine_selectors_for_index', {'index': index},
                                              browser_session=browser_session)
    # 2) persist in Selector Registry via orchestrator REST
    await send_selectors_to_registry(sel)
    # 3) perform the original click
    return await tools.registry.execute_action('click', {'index': index}, browser_session=browser_session)


Notes:
• browser‑use tools are the canonical way to extend/override actions; docs cover adding tools and available built‑ins. 
docs.browser-use.com
+1

• You can also use Agent History after run() to post‑process and emit a full deterministic flow (see §7). 
docs.browser-use.com

5) Breakpoints & wait gates (deterministic runner)

Define a tiny, declarative Breakpoint/Wait DSL the Playwright runner understands:

// /runner/src/lib/breakpoints.ts
import { expect, Page, Locator } from '@playwright/test';

export type WaitKind =
  | { type: 'selector-visible'; selector: string; timeout?: number }
  | { type: 'text'; text: string; timeout?: number }
  | { type: 'network-idle'; timeout?: number }
  | { type: 'custom-js'; script: string; timeout?: number };

export async function awaitGate(page: Page, gate: WaitKind) {
  switch (gate.type) {
    case 'selector-visible': await expect(page.locator(gate.selector)).toBeVisible({ timeout: gate.timeout ?? 15000 }); break;
    case 'text': await expect(page).toHaveText(new RegExp(gate.text, 'i'), { timeout: gate.timeout ?? 15000 }); break;
    case 'network-idle': await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle', { timeout: gate.timeout ?? 15000 }); break;
    case 'custom-js': await page.waitForFunction(gate.script, null, { timeout: gate.timeout ?? 15000 }); break;
  }
}


Use locator + web‑first assertions instead of raw waitForSelector where possible. 
playwright.dev
+1

Optional: in dev, allow page.pause() as an interactive breakpoint. (Playwright provides a debugger / codegen UI.) 
playwright.dev

6) AI fallback policy (healing & learning loop)

When a deterministic step fails in Playwright (timeout, missing locator, assert fail):

The runner posts a “recovery request” to the orchestrator with:

URL, last successful step, failing step, candidates tried, and the HTML snapshot/trace.

The orchestrator spins up browser‑use with a very specific “micro‑task”:

“On this page: <url>, click the <purpose> control. Fix broken locator. Stop once you complete the click and return new selectors.”

Keep it bounded: max_steps, step_timeout, and small LLM. (Browser‑use supports model selection and limits.) 
docs.browser-use.com
+1

Your wrapped tools mine selectors and report new candidates; orchestrator updates the Registry and generates a patch to the flow (PR).

Re‑run the failed test deterministically with the new primary candidate.

You get low steady‑state cost (deterministic path) with continuous learning whenever the UI drifts. You can also audit token costs via browser‑use’s cost monitoring. 
docs.browser-use.com

7) Emitting deterministic flows from agent runs

From the browser‑use Agent History you can map agent actions to Playwright code:

navigate(url) → await page.goto(url)

input(index, text) → await page.getByLabel(...).fill(text) (pick best candidate)

click(index) → await page.getByRole('button', { name: '...' }).click()

extract() → assertions or snapshot checks, depending on your flow.

Docs: agent .run() returns a history you can query; you can also fetch model actions, outputs, URLs for translation. 
docs.browser-use.com

Minimal generator (Python skeleton)

history = await agent.run(max_steps=50)
actions = history.model_actions()  # structured list of tool calls (click, input, navigate, etc.)
code_lines = ["import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';", "",
              "test('generated flow', async ({ page }) => {"]

for a in actions:
    if a.name == 'navigate':
        code_lines.append(f"  await page.goto('{a.args['url']}');")
    elif a.name == 'click_wrapped':
        sel = best_selector_for_step(a.meta['step_key'])  # from registry
        code_lines.append(f"  await {sel}.click();")
    elif a.name == 'input':
        sel = best_selector_for_step(a.meta['step_key'])
        code_lines.append(f"  await {sel}.fill('{escape(a.args['text'])}');")
    # ... others
code_lines.append("});")

write_to('/runner/tests/generated/generated.spec.ts', "\n".join(code_lines))

8) Deterministic flow format (source‑of‑truth)

Keep human‑readable YAML that the runner consumes and code‑gen expands:

name: checkout-add-to-cart
url: https://shop.example.com
steps:
  - key: open_home
    do: goto
    url: "{{url}}"
    wait:
      - { type: selector-visible, selector: "getByRole('link', { name: 'Shop' })" }

  - key: add_to_cart
    do: click
    selector_candidates:
      - "getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' })"
      - "[data-testid='add-to-cart']"
      - "css=button.btn-primary:has-text('Add to cart')"
    wait:
      - { type: text, text: "Added to cart" }
      - { type: network-idle }

  - key: go_to_cart
    do: click
    selector_candidates:
      - "getByRole('link', { name: 'Cart' })"
    breakpoint: true   # emit event/notification here


Your runner loads candidates in order, failing over to the next if needed. If all fail → AI fallback (§6).

9) Observability & debugging

browser‑use has a built‑in observability story: traces show agent steps aligned with the browser session recording (useful to diagnose agent behavior). It also ships telemetry and costs pages. 
docs.browser-use.com
+2
docs.browser-use.com
+2

Playwright Trace Viewer: inspect screenshots, actions, network for deterministic runs (CLI/HTML). 
playwright.dev
+1

10) Security & secrets

Use browser‑use Sensitive Data template to ensure secrets (PII, passwords, 2FA) are not sent to the LLM; keep them in a separate dict injected only at tool‑execution time. 
docs.browser-use.com

Optionally leverage allowed_domains and sandboxing options in browser‑use Browser parameters. 
docs.browser-use.com

11) Optional: sharing the same Chrome between agent and runner

If you want tight handoff (agent acts, then Playwright continues in the same Chrome instance), browser‑use provides a Playwright Integration example that shares a Chrome via CDP and allows the agent to call Playwright functions for deterministic steps. Start with their template and adapt the tool surface. 
docs.browser-use.com

12) CI/CD & parallel scaling

Use Playwright’s CI guide and fullyParallel with sharding across machines. Store HTML reports & traces as artifacts. 
playwright.dev

For very high concurrency, horizontally shard by flow files or tag. (Playwright parallelization and sharding are common practice.) 
playwright.dev

13) Implementation phases (with concrete outputs)

Phase 1 — Foundations (2–4 days)

Bootstrap repos and hello‑world agent & runner.

uv pip install browser-use (Chromium via Playwright). 
GitHub

npx playwright init (TypeScript).

Land schema & client for Selector Registry.

Deliverables: repo skeletons, simple flow, DB migrations, CI smoke job.

Phase 2 — Selector mining & flow generation (4–7 days)

Add wrapped tools (click_wrapped, input_wrapped) and selector miner that runs evaluate to collect attributes & build candidates. (browser‑use tools allow this). 
docs.browser-use.com

Implement lifecycle hooks to capture context and persist to registry. 
docs.browser-use.com

Write a history→Playwright codegen that emits .spec.ts into /runner/tests/generated.

Deliverables: generator CLI, 1–2 flows generated end‑to‑end; HTML+trace in CI.

Phase 3 — Breakpoints & DSL (2–4 days)

Implement Wait/Breakpoint DSL in the runner (§5).

Notify orchestrator (webhook) when a breakpoint is reached; optionally pause in dev with page.pause(). 
playwright.dev

Deliverables: YAML DSL, demo with a content‑gate and screenshot proof.

Phase 4 — AI fallback & continuous learning (5–8 days)

Add runner error hooks → orchestrator → agent micro‑task with strict max_steps, cheap model. (browser‑use supports model selection and parameter limits.) 
docs.browser-use.com

Update registry scores; auto‑PR patch to flow YAML when a better selector is found.

Add cost telemetry and dashboards (token $ per recovery). 
docs.browser-use.com

Deliverables: failing step healed automatically; PR diff shows selector update.

Phase 5 — Scale & hardening (ongoing)

Add sharding across CI machines; run 100s of tests in parallel. 
playwright.dev

Add anti‑bot optionality with Browser‑Use Cloud (use_cloud=True) if some targets block headless runs. 
GitHub

Build a “selector health” report: candidates, last success, failure rate.

14) Coding building blocks
14.1 Runner: choosing best selector
// /runner/src/lib/selectors.ts
export function toLocator(page, candidate: string) {
  // Accepts Playwright strings like: "getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' })"
  // or raw CSS: "css=button.btn-primary:has-text('Add to cart')"
  if (candidate.startsWith('getBy')) return eval(`page.${candidate}`); // vetted upstream
  if (candidate.startsWith('css=') || candidate.startsWith('//')) return page.locator(candidate);
  return page.locator(candidate); // CSS assumed
}

export async function clickWithFallback(page, candidates: string[]) {
  let lastErr;
  for (const c of candidates) {
    try { await toLocator(page, c).click(); return { ok: true, used: c }; }
    catch (e) { lastErr = e; }
  }
  return { ok: false, error: lastErr };
}

14.2 Runner: step execution with breakpoints
// /runner/src/lib/execStep.ts
import { awaitGate } from './breakpoints';
import { clickWithFallback } from './selectors';

export async function execStep(page, step) {
  if (step.do === 'goto') await page.goto(step.url);
  if (step.do === 'click') {
    const res = await clickWithFallback(page, step.selector_candidates);
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`All selector candidates failed for ${step.key}`);
  }
  if (step.do === 'input') {
    // similar fillWithFallback(...)
  }

  if (step.wait) for (const gate of step.wait) await awaitGate(page, gate);
  if (step.breakpoint) await notifyOrchestrator({ stepKey: step.key, url: page.url() });
}

14.3 Orchestrator: recovery hook (pseudo)
// On runner failure:
POST /recover
payload = { url, flowKey, stepKey, triedCandidates, traceUrl }

# Orchestrator:
- Launch browser-use Agent with task:
  "On {url}, complete step '{stepKey}' (purpose: {purpose}). Return updated selectors."
- Set small model + step caps.
- On success -> update registry + open PR to flow YAML.

15) Locator strategy (robustness defaults)

Prefer user‑facing locators—getByRole, getByLabel, getByText—over CSS/XPath; they are more stable and are what Playwright’s codegen produces by default. 
playwright.dev

Only fall back to CSS; avoid XPath unless necessary. 
playwright.dev
+1

You can even kickstart projects with Playwright codegen to see how it chooses locators, then teach your selector miner to mimic that prioritization. 
playwright.dev
+1

16) Model & performance tuning

Start with inexpensive, instruction‑tuned models for recovery tasks (browser‑use supports OpenAI‑compatible and Gemini; docs show how to set keys and pick models). 
docs.browser-use.com
+1

Cap max_steps, step_timeout, and prompt the agent specifically (browser‑use has a Prompting Guide you can adapt). 
docs.browser-use.com

Monitor Costs and Telemetry (opt‑out/anonymization toggles noted in docs). 
docs.browser-use.com
+1

17) Risk log & mitigations

Anti‑bot / headless detection → Integrate Browser‑Use Cloud for stealth browsers when necessary. 
GitHub

Flaky waits → codify waits as web‑first assertions and network idle gates (§5), not fixed sleeps. 
playwright.dev

Selector drift → the AI fallback loop (§6) + scores in the registry.

Security → route secrets via Sensitive Data template; restrict domains via Browser parameters. 
docs.browser-use.com
+1

Parallel conflicts with agents → If you run agents in parallel, browser‑use flags this as experimental; prefer deterministic flows for wide parallelism; keep agent fallback serial per run. 
docs.browser-use.com

18) Stretch goals

Same‑browser handoff (agent ↔ Playwright via CDP) for zero‑friction recovery (see Playwright Integration template). 
docs.browser-use.com

Page signature service that computes a robust fingerprint using landmarks and ARIA structure.

Auto‑PR bot that annotates diffs with screenshots, traces (Playwright trace viewer links). 
playwright.dev

19) References you’ll use directly

browser‑use repo & quickstart (install, Agent, ChatBrowserUse, use_cloud).

Want me to tailor this to your stack?

If you share your CI (GitHub Actions/Circle/etc.), preferred LLMs, and target browser matrix, I’ll fill in exact configs (workers/shards), baseline prompts for the micro‑recovery tasks, and a concrete schema + migration for the Selector Registry.
